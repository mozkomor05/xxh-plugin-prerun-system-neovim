# XXH - System neovim configuration

NeoVim plugin for xxh. This plugin is kind of untypical as it doesn't contain custom NeoVim configuration, but it rathers copies the system's files.

## Install

```sh
xxh +I xxh-plugin-zsh-system-neovim+git+https://github.com/mozkomor05/xxh-plugin-zsh-system-neovim
```
